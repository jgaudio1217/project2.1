		 				<div class="table1">We want to help by spreading awareness of Racial Injustice. Doing things such as reminding people of the past and educating on the present. Doing this we remember not to make the mistakes of the past. The more we educate one and other the stronger we are against racism and ignorance. As long as we don't give racism power it can't control us. </div>

				<div class="racial-table">To help you can tell your friends and family about Racial Injustice. Spread Awareness!!! You can also donate to non-profit organizations dedicated to helping people of color in need. Some of those are the NAACP, FIERCE, and the Reading Holiday Project. All three of these foundations help people of color conquer issues such as discrimination, education, and even politics.</div>
